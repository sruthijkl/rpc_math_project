CS 5523 RPC Project Report
--------------------------

Team: Nagasruthi Uppalapati, [Teammate Name]
Project: Math Client/Server using XML-RPC

Design:
- XML-RPC server handles math operations: add, subtract, min, max.
- Each method is thread-safe using threading.Lock.
- Server maintains call counters for each operation.

Testing:
- Each client sends 1000 requests randomly.
- `run_clients.py` runs 2 clients concurrently.
- Server prints final counters showing concurrent access handled correctly.

Result:
- Final counters reflect total requests.
- Demonstrated correct RPC communication and multithreaded handling.

Screenshots:

Conclusion:
- Successfully implemented and tested a distributed RPC math server with concurrent clients.
